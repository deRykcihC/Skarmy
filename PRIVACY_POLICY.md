The App accesses images and screenshots stored on your device's local storage solely for the purpose of providing the App's core functionality: analyzing and organizing your screenshots.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

### 2.1. Image Analysis
To provide AI-powered descriptions and tags for your screenshots, the App sends your selected images to the Google Gemini API (a third-party service provided by Google).

*   We do **not** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your images to outside parties, except to the Google Gemini API as described above.

All analysis results (descriptions, tags, categories) are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data.

## 3. Third-Party Services

## 5. Security

We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information. Your API key and analyzed data are stored locally on your device using the application's private storage.
