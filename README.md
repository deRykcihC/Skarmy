> **PixelShot Open Source** – *Formerly pixelshot_flutter*

**Skarmy** is an intelligent mobile gallery assistant that automatically analyzes, tags, and adds context to your screenshots, making them instantly searchable.

It acts as an open-source alternative to Pixel Screenshots, letting you utilize your own free **Gemini API Key** (via Google AI Studio) to unlock powerful context awareness for your visual data.

## Key Features
*   **Context & Tag Search:** Find screenshots by describing what's in them.
*   **Uncensored/Flexible:** Supports various content types (including NSFW) **depending on your API settings**.
*   **Bring Your Own Key:** You control the API usage and limits.

## Why Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite?
I specifically utilize the **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite** model by default because:
1.  **High Free Quotas:** It offers significantly higher daily limits compared to Pro/Flash or Standard models.
2.  **Efficiency:** It is lightweight and fast, providing more than sufficient intelligence for OCR and image tagging tasks without unnecessary latency.

***SIKE*** they limited the 2.0 flash lite for billed, please choose 2.5 models until further update

## Security & Privacy

**Is my data secure?**
The short answer: **It is private to your device, but stored in plain text.**

*   **Future Plans:** I plan to migrate sensitive credentials to secure storage in a future update. But for now, **it is what it is**.
